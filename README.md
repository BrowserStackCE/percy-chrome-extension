The Percy Chrome Extension is a versatile Chrome extension, developed within the Plasmo framework, designed to simplify visual testing and regression testing for your web applications. It offers a practical solution for users who don't have extensive automation setups and for Manual QA testers who want to streamline their visual regression testing processes.

## Introduction

Visual testing is a critical aspect of ensuring the quality and consistency of web applications. However, not all users have the resources or expertise to set up complex automation systems. The Percy Chrome Extension caters to a variety of user groups:

### Users without Automation Setup

For those who lack advanced automation setups but still wish to perform visual testing on pages protected by authentication, Percy Chrome Extension provides a straightforward solution. It allows users to access these secured pages using basic authentication or static cookies, eliminating the need to rely on developers for cookie provisioning.

### Manual QA Testers

Manual Quality Assurance (QA) testers play a pivotal role in maintaining application quality. With the Percy Chrome Extension, Manual QA testers can efficiently perform visual regression testing. Instead of configuring separate testing environments with complex .yml or .json files, they can use the extension to add URLs and seamlessly integrate visual testing into their manual workflows.


## Streamlining Manual QA Workflows

While many companies are transitioning to automation, some users prefer or require manual workflows for various reasons. The Percy Chrome Extension caters to these users, offering a user-friendly visual regression testing tool that seamlessly fits into manual QA processes. It simplifies the task of maintaining web application visual integrity, making it accessible to all.


## Getting Started

To begin using the Percy Chrome Extension, follow these straightforward steps:

- **Extension Installation**: Install the Percy Chrome Extension directly from the Chrome Web Store.


- **Desktop App Installation**: Install the Percy Desktop App directly if not already Installed. Please follow the documentation to install the app.


- **Enable Extension and Desktop App**: Enable the chrome extension and desktop app.

- **Capture Snapshot**: Once you have desktop app and chrome extension enabled, go to the website/web app and start capturing snapshots. You can either capture the content individually for all the pages or use the Auto Capture functionality to automatically capture all the web pages while performing you end to end iteration.

- **Effortless Visual Testing**: Effortlessly access secured pages or workflows protected by authentication using basic auth or static cookies. No longer depend on developers for cookie setup.

- **Manual QA Testing Simplified**: For manual QA testers, add the URLs you wish to test directly within the extension. Conduct visual regression testing as an integral part of your manual workflow, without dealing with complex .yml or .json files.
